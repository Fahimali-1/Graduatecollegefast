											<h1>How to Graduate from College Quickly  <br />

											<p>Something your College Advisor rarely mentions</p>
										</header>
										<p>What people don't know is that a lot of college students waste their time by taking Gen.Ed and Pre-Req classes. A lot of students end up having to take the same classes they did in their senior year of high school...all over again freshmen year of college.<p>What a lot of people don't know is that One of easiest, fastest, and cheapest ways to <strong>Graduate Quickly </strong>is to

										<h2>What are the DSST or CLEP exams exactly? </h2>

									<div class="posts">
										<article>
											
												<p>These are both multiple choice exams covering a variety of topics from basic English Literature, to much more comprehensive topics such as the Soviet War or Geology and Astrology.<p>
												</article>
												<article>
													<p>The DSST exams contain 100 multiple choice questions with a 2 hour time limit and the CLEP exams contain 90-120 multiple choice questions (based on the topic) with a 90 minute time limit.<p>
													</article>
													<article>	
													</p>Both of these exams were created to test and give college credits to individuals who have knowledge on a topic or subject already.<P>
													</article>
													<article>
											       	 Keep in mind each exam comes with a fee. DDST - $100 + Seating fees & CLEP ~ $90 + Seating fees. This is primarily the reason a lot of advisors do not mention these exams at times. However, if you can afford the costs then it would be very beneficial for you. Also I will tell you the easiest ones to take and the resources to use to study for them.</p>
												
												</article>
												<article>
										       <p><strong>IF YOU PASS ANY OF THESE EXAMS, YOU WILL RECIEVE 3 COLLEGE CREDITS !!!!!! (Some colleges offer 6 Credits for Math Exams)</strong></p>

											<h3>Where and How to take an Exam?</h3>
											<p>DSST - You have to take it at a testing site, you can search for the closest one <a href="https://www.getcollegecredit.com/search/" target="_blank"> here</a>
												<p>CLEP - You can take this exam online with a Remote Proctor with this <a href="https://clep.collegeboard.org/register-for-an-exam/registering-remote-proctoring" target="_blank">link</a>
												<p>However, if you would rather go to a testing center to take the exams you can find the closest one with this <a href="https://clep.collegeboard.org/clep-test-center-search" target="_blank">link</a><p>

										</article>
										<article>
											<h3>BEFORE YOU CHOOSE AN EXAM!!!</h3>
											<p>DO NOT TAKE A EXAM that matches a college course you have passed. Your college will most likely not give you credit. Double check your degreeworks, and see if the subject and topic of the class matches the exam. <P></P>Other than that you can simply just ask your school or advisor for a DSST/CLEP exam conversion sheet, and this will show you the exams and the EQUIVALENT course your school offers.</p>

											<h3>Best Exams to Take- DSST</h3>
											<p>I have taken and passed 5 DSST exams:
												<p>PERSONAL FINANCE, TECHNICAL WRITING, ETHICS IN TECHNOLOGY, ETHICS IN BUSINESS, & HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
												<p>These were by far the easiest to study for and these exams incorpated a lot of real life knowledge and simple scenerios.<p>
												</article>
												<article>
													<h3>How to Study for the DSST</h3>
													<p>I used Study.com to prepare for these exams. It costs $60 for one month (the same month i had taken all of these exams) and covers every important topic for each exam. They offer simple videos and easy to follow texts that help cover all exam material!</p>
													<p>You can pretty much study or review the videos and then take an exam at the end of the week (I had taken 2 exams every saturday, but focus on one exam first and I would highly recommend the Personal Finanec or Technical Writing as a good first exam) </p>
												</article>
												<article>
													<h3>Best CLEP exams to take and How to Study for them?</h3>
													<p>I persoanlly have not taken any CLEP exams however from my own judgement and from what others have reported, "Analyzing and Interperting Literature" would be the Easiest in my opinion. However just like the DSST list, go through every topic and decide which you feel like you can pass and study for easily.</p>
													<p>If you decide to study for the CLEP exams, Study.com would be the best and affordable resource you should use.  </p>
													<p>Also here is the most recent pass scores from military personnel, who get to take the exam for free. You can use this to see how likely you might be able to pass a topic, or which topics you might need to study before taking the exam for it.
